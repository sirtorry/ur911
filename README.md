# ur911
In some emergency situations, calling 911 is not an option but texting is. Unfortunately, most emergency call centers do not accept text messages. ur911 allows you to text to it. When we receive your message, we will dial the nearest call center and read out your text message. There's also the option of message forwarding for registered users.
